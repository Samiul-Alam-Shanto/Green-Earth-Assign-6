#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

Answer:

Var,let and const is the different styles of declaring a variable.

If a variable is declared with var it can be accessed from anywhere and can be reassigned anytime and don't limit itself between block{}.It is the old way and not recommended now.

Let is the modern way of declaring a variable and i also can be changed but it works only inside block.

Const is also the modern way . once a variable is declared with const it can't be changed but for non-primitive values we can update value in it.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

Answer:

These are also methods to loop through an array.

forEach() goes through each item of an array but doesn't return anything

map() goes through each item and makes a new array with the results.

filter() goes through each item and makes a new array with only the items that match a specific condition.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Answer:

Template literals are strings which is written with backticks(``). We can use variables or multiline  
string or conditions even array or object property in it.

string concatenation is used with + but we can now use template literals (``) and in this we can use expressions using ${}. so instead of using + by using ${} we can put variables and make an expression.
